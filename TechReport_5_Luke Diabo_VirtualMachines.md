# What are Virtual Machines?

A virtual machine or a VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer system within a host machine. Emualating an operating system and applications.

VMs can offer better resource deployment, isolation of applications, and enhanced security

Virtual machines offer flexibility and portability, providing benefits such as:

- Cost savings—Using multiple virtual environments on a single infrastructure reduces the physical footprint, lowering server maintenance and electricity costs.
- Agility and speed—Creating a new VM is faster and easier than setting up a new device for developers.
- Reduced downtime—VMs can be easily moved between hypervisors, making them useful for backup. 
- Scalability—VMs simplify app scaling by adding physical or virtual servers, improving app availability and performance.
- Security—VMs can run multiple operating systems, allowing you to use a guest OS for insecure apps, protecting your host OS. They enhance security and can isolate viruses, making them useful for safely studying malware.

Vms do have some drawbacks though such as:

- Running multiple virtual machines on one physical machine can result in unstable performance if requirements are not met.
- Virtual machines are less efficient and run slower than a full physical computer. Most OS verisons use a combination of physical and virtual infrastructure to balance advantages and disadvantages.
